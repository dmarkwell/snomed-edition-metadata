# snomed-edition-metadata
exploratory space for developing machine-readable metadata for a SNOMED Edition

# Human-oriented info in descriptions file with new description types
# Start with single JSON object
  * Edition-level content
  * Refset-level content
  * Type & instance level content (eg historical assocâ€™n refsets)

  * Need a property-namespace mechanism
  * ECL for range constraints
  * Other sub-languages: concrete domain constraints?  Regex? Human readable?
